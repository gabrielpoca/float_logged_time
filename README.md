# FLoat Logged Time

Command-line utility to quickly log 8 hours a day for a person in
a project in the current week. If you run it twice, it will update the
days according to the new answer.

To run it, you need to set the env variables `FLOAT_ACCESS_KEY`,
`FLOAT_PEOPLE_ID` and `FLOAT_PROJECT_ID`.

Use `bin/start` to run the project and `bin/compile` to compile it to
a single binary.

It runs on Deno, so you need to have it on your system.
